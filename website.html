    <p>I feel extremetly grateful right now, it is incredible how you can learn so much for free. Who are those heroes? Where are those that contributed to make this phenomena even posible? I would like to meet them and express them how grateful i am.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>I have learned so much!!!</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought that programming was too difficult for a poor guy like me to learn it, but i have use the same power that my scientific heroes have done before me, <strong><em>Scientific skeptism!</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>With scientific skeptism and knowing that khan academy make learning fun, i asked myself the right questions that put me in this journy.</p>
    <p class="subtitules">It was once almost imposible</p>
    
    <p>If one thinks about other periods of time, learning was way more difficult in the sense that it was difficult to get, but thanks to the great scientists since the scientific revolution we are in this moment where i can learn so much!</p>
    
    <p class="subtitules">Some heroes i think contributed to this awesome phenomena</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="greatscientist">Thomas edison<p>With his inventions and innovations with electricity and more.</p></li>
        <li class="greatscientist">Alan Turing<p>Making big steps in the direction of computer development and <em>artificial inteligence</em>.</p></li>
        <li class="greatscientist">Tim Berners-Lee<p>The guy that invented the internet.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other posibles contributors...</p>
    <ul>
            <li class="greatscientist">George Boole</li>
            <li class="greatscientist">Gottfried Leibniz</li>
            <li class="greatscientist">Many others...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I love to learn. For whatever reason i feel energy running throught my brain when i learn something new and exciting.</p>
    <p>Is very exciting to talk about what i have learned and to share thatknowledge too. Later i have learn a lot on programming, much more that i could ever imagine thanks to khan academy.

    <p>One of my dreams is to understant Einsteins's theory of relativity and be a master in physics, I love the physical world! When i was a kid a used to watch a lot of science channel like Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Also my grandfather was a biology teacher and he use to show me pictures of a lot of exotic animals in his enciclopedya</p>
    
    <p>Learning is so awesome!</p>
